# SocketClient

SocketClient is a simple Python module that provides a TCP/IP socket client for communicating with a server over a network. It allows you to send and receive data over the network using the socket protocol.

Socket client can:
  - Send user input to a server
  - Receive responses from the server
  - Configure logging levels for how much information about the socket connection the user would like to see
  
Usage: ```java TCPClient <host> <port> [--loglevel=<level>]```
